<Head title="Dumb little homepage" />

<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Temporary homepage</h1>
<p class="md:w-120 sm:w-96">
	I wanted to get something put on the homepage for now as this domain's been dead since i stopped
	using laravel, hey at least it's got some dark mode. I might develop like a commissions portal to
	replace my <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/laratheprotogen">buymeacoffee you can find here</a>
	but I don't know, right now I just want a blog using mdsvex and comments using github (either via
	giscus or github oauth), I was also considering using
	<a href="https://fresh.deno.dev">the Deno Fresh full-stack framework</a> but I like svelte
